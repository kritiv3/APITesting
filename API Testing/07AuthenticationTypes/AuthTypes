Authentication Types
-------------------------
1. Basic Authentication
    -> needs username and password for authorization 

2. Digest Authentication
    -> it also requires username and password for authorization but in an encrypted format
    -> sends an encrypted format to server
    -> Digest Auth is more secure than Basic Auth due to encryption

3. Bearer Type Authentication
    -> needs access token to access APIs

4. OAuth 1.0(Open Authorization)
